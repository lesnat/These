	%abstract = {Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is the mathematical and conceptualframework for contemporary elementary particle physics.  In a ratherinformal sense QFT is the extension of quantum mechanics (QM), dealingwith particles, over to fields, i.e. systems with an infinite numberof degrees of freedom. (See the entry on quantum mechanics.)In the last few years QFT has become a more widely discussedtopic in philosophy of science, with questions ranging frommethodology and semantics to ontology.  QFT taken seriously in itsmetaphysical implications seems to give a picture of the world whichis at variance with central classical conceptions of particles andfields, and even with some features of QM., The following sketches how QFT describes fundamental physics and whatthe status of QFT is among other theories of physics. Since there is astrong emphasis on those aspects of the theory that are particularlyimportant for interpretive inquiries, it does not replace anintroduction to QFT as such. One main group of target readers arephilosophers who want to get a first impression of some issues thatmay be of interest for their own work, another target group arephysicists who are interested in a philosophical view upon QFT.},

	%abstract = {The question of whether virtual quantum particles exist is considered here in light of previous critical analysis and under the assumption that there are particles in the world as described by quantum field theory. The relationship of the classification of particles to quantum-field-theoretic calculations and the diagrammatic aids that are often used in them is clarified. It is pointed out that the distinction between virtual particles and others and, therefore, judgments regarding their reality have been made on basis of these methods rather than on their physical characteristics. As such, it has obscured the question of their existence. It is here argued that the most influential arguments against the existence of virtual particles but not other particles fail because they either are arguments against the existence of particles in general rather than virtual particles per se, or are dependent on the imposition of classical intuitions on quantum systems, or are simply beside the point. Several reasons are then provided for considering virtual particles real, such as their descriptive, explanatory, and predictive value, and a clearer characterization of virtuality\&mdash;one in terms of intermediate states\&mdash;that also applies beyond perturbation theory is provided. It is also pointed out that in the role of force mediators, they serve to preclude action-at-a-distance between interacting particles. For these reasons, it is concluded that virtual particles are as real as other quantum particles.},

Two main problems are discussed first, what can one find out from the investigation of the two-photon production of hadrons and how, and second,how can the two-photon production of of leptons be used? The basic method for extracting information on the $\gamma$ $\gamma$ → h (hadrons) transition — the ee → eeh reaction — is discussed in detail. In particular, we discuss what information on the $\gamma$ $\gamma$ → h transition can be extracted from the related experiments and how it can be done. One examines which questions in hadrodynamics and photohadron interaction physics can be answered by such investigations. It is emphasized that their main peculiarity is the possibility of investigating dependence of the amplitude on the energy as well as on the masses of both colliding particles (photons). The applications of two-photon lepton production in experimental high energy physics are discussed (the form factor investigation, the search for the real part of some forward scattering amplitudes, some auxiliary problems, etc.). Applications to the search for new (hypothetical) particles are considered. A number of important differential distributions are given. Cross section estimations for different for different experimental set ups are obtained. A critical discussion of the equivalent photon approximation is given.},

Basic models of femtosecond laser–solid interaction are described including collisional absorption, transport, hydrodynamics, fast electron and hard x-ray generation, together with recently predicted phenomena at extreme intensities, such as gigagauss magnetic fields and induced transparency. New developments in the complementary field of nonlinear propagation in ionized gases are reviewed, including field ionization, relativistic selffocusing, wakefield generation and scattering instabilities. Applications in the areas of x-ray generation for medical and biological imaging, new coherent light sources, nonlinear wave guiding and particle acceleration are also examined.},

However, these detailed analyses of the emission mechanisms were mainly based on 1D simulations and so did not incorporate some important 2D effects. In this paper these 1D emission mechanisms are confirmed to still exist in 2D with comparable properties and a new, intrinsically 2D, emission mechanism, termed edgeglow, is described which can convert 4–5\% of the laser energy into gamma-ray energy.},

The first two processes have been treated in quantum mechanics by Bethe, Møller, and Bloch in a very satisfactory way. A provisional estimation of the order of magnitude to be expected in the third process has been given by Heitler. The result obtained was that the cross-section ϕ for the energy loss by radiation for very fast particles (if the primary energy E0 ≫ mc2) is of the order ϕ ∽ Z2/137 (e2/mc2)2, (1) Where Z is the nuclear charge. It is the aim of the present paper to discuss in greater detain the rate of loss of energy by this third process and its dependence on the primary energy; in particular we shall consider the effect of screening. The results obtained for very high energies (> 137 mc2) seem to be in disagreement with experiments made by Anderson (cf. 7).},

	%abstract = {Electron acceleration by ultrahigh intensity lasers is studied by means of two-dimensional planar particle-in-cell simulations. It is shown that the full divergence of the fast electron beam is defined by two complementary physical effects: the regular radial beam deviation depending on the electron radial position and the angular dispersion. If the scale length of the preplasma surrounding the solid target is sufficiently low, the radial deviation is determined by the transverse component of the laser ponderomotive force. The random angular dispersion is due to the small scale magnetic fields excited near the critical density due to the collisionless Weibel instability. When a preplasma is present, the radial beam deviation increases due to the electron acceleration in larger volumes and can become comparable to the local angular dispersion. This effect has been neglected so far in most of the fast electron transport calculations, overestimating significantly the beam collimation by resistive magnetic fields. Simulations with a two-dimensional cylindrically-symmetric hybrid code accounting for the electron radial velocity demonstrate a substantially reduced strength and a shorter penetration of the azimuthal magnetic field in solid targets.},

Some of these electrons are escaping the target, leaving behind a significant positive electric charge and creating a strong electromagnetic pulse long after the end of the laser pulse. We propose here a detailed model of the target electric polarization induced by a short and intense laser pulse and an escaping electron bunch. A specially designed experiment provides direct measurements of the target polarization and the discharge current in the function of the laser energy, pulse duration, and target size. Large-scale numerical simulations describe the energetic electron generation and their emission from the target. The model, experiment, and numerical simulations demonstrate that the hot-electron ejection may continue long after the laser pulse ends, enhancing significantly the polarization charge.},

Our results represent the first such measurements at laser intensities ≥10^21 W × cm−2 and pulse durations ≤150 fs. We obtain a maximum yield of X-ray and gamma ray energy with respect to laser energy of 4\% and a mean yield of 2\%. We further obtain a Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of the gamma angular distribution of 33°. We were able to characterize the gamma-ray spectrum from 3 MeV to 50 MeV using a Forward Compton Electron Spectrometer, with an energy resolution of 10–15\% and mean bremsstrahlung effective kT of ∼6 MeV. We were able to characterize the spectrum from 1 to 5 MeV using a Filter Stack (attenuation) Spectrometer, measuring a mean X-ray temperature for the spectrum from 3 to 5 MeV of 2.1 MeV, suggesting that the low-energy gammas are bremsstrahlung from secondary electrons.},

Above 1014 eV, the high-energy cosmic photon spectrum should essentially cut off because of the strong absorption by the cosmic 3°K blackbody photons, and at higher energies by the cosmic radio photons.},

Here we present a highly efficient gamma photon emitter obtained by irradiating a high-intensity laser pulse on a miniature plasma device consisting of a plasma lens and a plasma mirror. This concept exploits strong spatiotemporal laser-shaping process and high-charge electron acceleration process in the plasma lens, as well as an efficient nonlinear Compton scattering process enabled by the plasma mirror. Our full three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that in this novel scheme, brilliant $\gamma$-rays with very high conversion efficiency (higher than 10−2) and spectral intensity (∼109 ) can be achieved by employing currently available petawatt-class lasers with intensity of 1021 W cm−2.

	%abstract = {More than 80 years have passed since the first calculations of electron–nucleus bremsstrahlung cross sections were published by Sommerfeld, for non-relativistic electrons, and, independently, by Sauter, Bethe and Heitler, and Racah, for relativistic electrons. The Bethe–Heitler expression, that is based on the first Born approximation and includes the screening of the Coulomb field of the nucleus by the atomic electrons, has proven to work well at moderately high energies where the Landau–Pomeranchuk–Migdal effect is negligible. We review the current theoretical and experimental status with a highlight on electrons with kinetic energies between 1 and 10MeV. The choice is motivated by the peculiar difficulties present in this energy region, where it is necessary to treat simultaneously the interaction with the Coulomb field beyond the first Born approximation and the effect of screening. A fully numerical approach within the S–matrix formalism has proven to be extremely difficult above a few MeV, because the number of partial waves needed for an accurate evaluation is prohibitively large. Here we focus on analytic results, including the more complex ones employing the Furry–Sommerfeld–Maue wave functions and taking into account the next-to-leading order, and discuss the advantages and limitations in light of the best available data. The influence of multiple scattering in the target is investigated under the actual experimental conditions. A comparison with the widely used cross section tabulations by Seltzer and Berger is also presented.},

	%abstract = {This account briefly traces the growth of our theoretical and experimental knowledge of electron–positron pair production by photons, from the prediction of the positron by Dirac [1928a. The quantum theory of the electron. Proc. R. Soc. (London) A 117, 610–624; 1928b. The quantum theory of the electron. Part II. Proc. R. Soc. (London) A 118, 1928b, 351–361] and subsequent cloud-chamber observations by Anderson [Energies of cosmic-ray particles. Phys. Rev. 43, 491–494], up to the present time. Photons of energies above 2mec2 (1.022MeV) can interact with the Coulomb field of an atomic nucleus to be transformed into an electron–positron pair, the probability increasing with increasing photon energy, up to a plateau at high energies, and increasing with increasing atomic number approximately as the square of the nuclear charge (proton number). This interaction can also take place in the field of an atomic electron, for photons of energy in excess of 4mec2 (2.044MeV), in which case the process is called triplet production due to the track of the recoiling atomic electron adding to the tracks of the created electron–positron pair. The last systematic computations and tabulations of pair and triplet cross sections, which are the predominant contributions to the photon mass attenuation coefficient for photon energies 10MeV and higher, were those of Hubbell et al. [Pair, triplet, and total atomic cross sections (and mass attenuation coefficients) for 1MeV–100GeV photons in elements Z=1–100. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 9, 1023–1147], from threshold (1.022MeV) up to 100GeV, for all elements Z=1–100. These computations required some ad hoc bridging functions between the available low-energy and high-energy theoretical models. Recently (1979–2001), Sud and collaborators have developed some new approaches including using distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) theory to compute pair production cross sections in the intermediate energy region (5.0–10.0MeV) on a firmer theoretical basis. These and other recent developments, and their possible implications for improved computations of pair and triplet cross sections, are discussed.},

The number of background pairs per bunch crossing due to the Breit-Wheeler, Bethe-Heitler and Landau-Lifshitz processes is well-known. However, the Breit-Wheeler process also takes place in and is modified by the bunch fields. A full QED calculation of this stimulated Breit-Wheeler process reveals cross-section resonances due to the virtual particle reaching the mass shell. The one-loop electron self-energy in the bunch field is also calculated and included as a radiative correction. The bunch field is considered to be a constant crossed electromagnetic field with associated bunch field photons. Resonance is found to occur whenever the energy of contributed bunch field photons is equal to the beamstrahlung photon energy. The stimulated Breit-Wheeler cross-section exceeds the ordinary Breit-Wheeler cross-section by several orders of magnitude and a significantly different pair background may result.},

The basis is a linear integrated-over-angle intensity spectrum, a Gaussian bremsstrahlung cross section angular distribution, a Gaussian electron multiple scattering angular distribution, a constant electron stopping power, and a linear function representing both photon attenuation within the radiator and the electron transmission function through the radiator, from which is derived an analytic expression involving the exponential integral ei(x).

	%abstract = {During the interaction of an intense picosecond laser pulse with a plasma created by a plastic foil ablated by a nanosecond laser pulse, relativistic electrons are produced. A metal solid target placed behind the foil allows converting these high-energy electrons into hard X-rays. The use of an ablated CH foil allows maximizing the conversion efficiency and thus the X-ray emission. In this study, the photon energy spectrum and dose are measured for different thicknesses of various metal targets such as tantalum. Numerical simulations including hydrodynamical radiative, particle-in-cell, and Monte Carlo codes are made to give comparison with the experimental data. These are also compared with that of a bremsstrahlung emission and photon dose model in which the energy loss by Ohmic heating arising from the return current driven by the background electrons of the conductive target is taken into account [A. Compant La Fontaine, Phys. Plasmas 25, 043301 (2018)]. The results obtained allow for benchmarks to test the accuracy of this model and to check that the dose is maximized for high-Z solid targets and thickness in the mm range in the relativistic interaction regime at ultrahigh laser intensity (>1018 W/cm2).},

	%abstract = {The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) accelerates nuclei to ultra-relativistic velocities, producing some of the strongest known magnetic fields in the Universe ($\{10^\{14\}-10^\{15\}\}$ Tesla). The highly Lorentz-contracted Coulomb fields of the nuclei generate a flux of linearly polarized quasi-real photons that can interact via the Breit-Wheeler process to produce electron-positron pairs ($\{\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-\}$). Experimental data presented in this article are consistent with Breit-Wheeler theory across all measured differentials. The detected pairs are produced predominantly at low transverse momentum ($P\_\{\perp\}$) with a smooth invariant mass distribution, with the individual $\{e^\pm\}$ preferentially aligned along the beam direction, and with a 4th-order modulation in azimuth between the $\{e^+e^-\}$ pair and $\{e^\pm\}$ momenta. The $P\_\{\perp\}$ spectrum broadens from large to small impact parameters. Our observation opens new opportunities to study Quantum Chromodynamics under extreme conditions and provides a new tool for interdisciplinary study of extreme electromagnetic fields.},

This was largely based on facility specifications, with some description of their uses, for instance in fundamental ultra-high-intensity interactions, secondary source generation, and inertial confinement fusion (ICF). With the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics being awarded to Professors Donna Strickland and Gerard Mourou for the development of the technique of chirped pulse amplification (CPA), which made these lasers possible, we celebrate by providing a comprehensive update of the current status of ultra-high-power lasers and demonstrate how the technology has developed. We are now in the era of multi-petawatt facilities coming online, with 100 PW lasers being proposed and even under construction. In addition to this there is a pull towards development of industrial and multi-disciplinary applications, which demands much higher repetition rates, delivering high-average powers with higher efficiencies and the use of alternative wavelengths: mid-IR facilities. So apart from a comprehensive update of the current global status, we want to look at what technologies are to be deployed to get to these new regimes, and some of the critical issues facing their development.},

	%abstract = {Outstanding progress has been made in high-power laser technology in the last 10 years with laser powers reaching petawatt (PW) values. At present, there are 15 PW lasers built or being built around the world and plans are afoot for new, even higher power, lasers reaching values of exawatt (EW) or even zetawatt (ZW) powers. Petawatt lasers generate electric fields of 1012 V m−1 with a large fraction of the total pulse energy being converted to relativistic electrons with energies reaching in excess of 1 GeV. In turn these electrons result in the generation of beams of protons, heavy ions, neutrons and high-energy photons. These laser-driven particle beams have encouraged many to think of carrying out experiments normally associated with conventional nuclear accelerators and reactors. To this end a number of introductory articles have been written under a trial name ‘Laser Nuclear Physics’ (Ledingham and Norreys 1999 Contemp. Phys. 40 367, Ledingham et al 2002 Europhys. News. 33 120, Ledingham et al 2003 Science 300 1107, Takabe et al 2001 J. Plasma Fusion Res. 77 1094). However, even greater strides have been made in the last 3 or 4 years in laser technology and it is timely to reassess the potential of laser-driven particle and photon beams. It must be acknowledged right from the outset that to date laserdriven particle beams have yet to compete favourably with conventional nuclear accelerator-generated beams in any way and so this is not a paper comparing laser and conventional accelerators. However, occasionally throughout the paper as a reality check, it will be mentioned what conventional nuclear accelerators can do.},

Particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that these fields significantly enhance the radiation rates of the laser-irradiated electrons, and furthermore they collimate the emission so that a directed and dense beam of multi-MeV gamma-rays is achievable. This capability can be exploited for electron–positron pair production via the linear Breit–Wheeler process by colliding two such dense beams. Presented simulations show that more than 103 pairs can be produced in such a setup, and the directionality of the positrons can be controlled by the angle of incidence between the beams.},

We propose a novel approach of positron production by using a femto-second laser irradiating a microstructured surface target combined with a high-Z converter. By numerical simulations, it is shown that both the temperature and the maximum kinetic energy of electrons can be greatly enhanced by using a microstructured surface target instead of a planar target. When these energetic electrons shoot into a high Z converter, copious positrons are produced via Bethe-Heitler mechanism. With a laser (wavelength λ = 1 μm) with duration ~36 fs, intensity ~5.5 × 1020 W/cm2 and energy ~6 Joule, ~109 positrons can be obtained.},

	%abstract = {Using three-dimensional kinetic simulations, we examine the emission of collimated $\gamma$-ray beams from structured laser-irradiated targets with a prefilled cylindrical channel and its scaling with laser power (in the multi-PW range). The laser power is increased by increasing the laser energy and the size of the focal spot while keeping the peak intensity fixed at 5×1022W/cm2. The channel radius is increased proportionally to accommodate the change in laser spot size. The efficiency of conversion of the laser energy into a beam of MeV-level $\gamma$ rays (with a 10∘ opening angle) increases rapidly with the incident laser power P before it roughly saturates above P≈4PW. Detailed particle tracking reveals that the power scaling is a result of enhanced electron acceleration at higher laser powers. One application that directly benefits from such a strong scaling is pair production via two-photon collisions. We investigate two schemes for generating pairs through the linear Breit-Wheeler process: colliding two $\gamma$-ray beams and colliding one $\gamma$-ray beam with black-body radiation. The two scenarios project up to 104 and 105 pairs, respectively, for the $\gamma$-ray beams generated at P=4PW. A comparison with a regime of laser-irradiated hollow channels corroborates the robustness of the setup with prefilled channels.},

Previously, the required laser intensity was not maintained over the distance needed to reach GeV energies, and hence acceleration was limited to the 100 MeV scale3,4,5.

	%abstract = {More than 80 years have passed since the first calculations of electron–nucleus bremsstrahlung cross sections were published by Sommerfeld, for non-relativistic electrons, and, independently, by Sauter, Bethe and Heitler, and Racah, for relativistic electrons. The Bethe–Heitler expression, that is based on the first Born approximation and includes the screening of the Coulomb field of the nucleus by the atomic electrons, has proven to work well at moderately high energies where the Landau–Pomeranchuk–Migdal effect is negligible. We review the current theoretical and experimental status with a highlight on electrons with kinetic energies between 1 and 10MeV. The choice is motivated by the peculiar difficulties present in this energy region, where it is necessary to treat simultaneously the interaction with the Coulomb field beyond the first Born approximation and the effect of screening. A fully numerical approach within the S–matrix formalism has proven to be extremely difficult above a few MeV, because the number of partial waves needed for an accurate evaluation is prohibitively large. Here we focus on analytic results, including the more complex ones employing the Furry–Sommerfeld–Maue wave functions and taking into account the next-to-leading order, and discuss the advantages and limitations in light of the best available data. The influence of multiple scattering in the target is investigated under the actual experimental conditions. A comparison with the widely used cross section tabulations by Seltzer and Berger is also presented.},

	%abstract = {Laser-driven gamma-ray source potentially offers a compact, cost-effective, ultra-short, and ultra-bright alternative to conventional gamma-ray sources based on large-scale particle accelerators. Based on the laser-driven approach, we use multidimensional particle-in-cell simulations to demonstrate that a nanostructured double-layer target, which consists of a nanostructured foam coated on top of a metal substrate, can absorb laser energy into high-energy electrons in the nanostructured foam, and then efficiently convert it into copious gamma photons via the nonlinear Compton scattering process enabled by the solid-density substrate, which acts as a plasma mirror to reﬂect the laser pulse. The effects of different nanostructures in the foam target and the oblique laser incidence are presented. It is shown that the conversion efficiency of gamma photons increases when the size of nanoparticles decreases or the filling factor of nanoparticles increases in nanostructured foam target, but decreases when the laser incidence angle increases. At realistic conditions with nanostructured foam and non-normal incidence, the double-layer target still exhibits an unprecedentedly high conversion efficiency in high-energy gamma-ray production due to the laser reﬂection by the plasma mirror, which can be two and even three orders of magnitude higher than that of the single-layer target without the substrate using currently available lasers with intensity of 1021 W cm2.},

This article intends to discriminate the different laser scenarios that have been proposed over the past few years as well as to give scaling laws for future experiments. The energy conversion from lasers or particles to high-frequency photons is addressed for both the well-known counter propagating electron beam-laser interaction and quantum-electrodynamics cascades triggered by various lasers.

Experiments and kinetic simulations show that large gaps between the wires favour the generation of high-energy electrons via laser acceleration into the channels while gaps smaller than the amplitude of electron quivering in the laser field lead to less energetic electrons and multi-keV plasma generation, in agreement with previously published experiments. Plasma filling of nano-sized gaps due to picosecond pedestal typical of ultrashort pulses strongly affects the interaction with this class of targets reducing the laser penetration depth to approximately one hundred nanometers. The two heating regimes appear potentially suitable for laser-driven ion/electron acceleration schemes and warm dense matter investigation respectively.},

Planar targets (from 7 to 20 μm) with protruding gold nanowires having different total areal densities, lengths, and diameters, ranging from 3\% to 60\% of the size of the laser focal spot were used during an experimental campaign at the 3 J, 30 fs HERCULES laser facility. The results show the importance of the average number of nanowires per focal spot, N, on laser energy absorption. We show that the proton acceleration is significantly improved by using 1 nanowires per focal spot. Detailed analysis indicates that 1 nanowire per focal spot optimizes the interaction between laser pulse and nanowires, in which the wings of the pulse pull out electrons from the wires forming a plasma with density that allows for deep penetration of the laser pulse into the array. When moving away from this optimum in both directions, N=1 and N?1, the laser pulse-nanowire coupling is either too weak or unfavorable for obtaining maximum proton energy. Proton spectra are compared to simulations using 2D-3V particle-in-cell code which reproduces the experimental data with good agreement.},

Plasma physics can be combined with materials and nuclear science, radiation detection and advanced laser technology, leading to novel research challenges of great fundamental and applicative interest. In this paper we present interesting and comprehensive results on nanostructured low density (near-critical) foam targets for TW and PW-class lasers, obtained in the framework of the European Research Council ENSURE project. Numerical simulations and experimental activities carried out at 100 s TW and PW-class laser facilities have shown that targets consisting of a solid foil coated with a nanostructured low-density (near-critical) foam can lead to an enhancement of the ion acceleration process. This stimulated a thorough numerical investigation of superintense laserinteraction with nanostructured near-critical plasmas. Thanks to a deep understanding of the foam growth process via the pulsed laser deposition technique and to the complementary capabilities of high-power impulse magnetron sputtering, advanced multi-layer targets based on near-critical films with carefully controlled properties (e.g. density gradients over few microns length scales) can now be manufactured, with applications outreaching the field of laser-driven ion acceleration. Additionally, comprehensive numerical and theoretical work has allowed the design of dedicated experiments and a realistic table-top apparatus for laser-driven materials irradiation, ion beam analysis and neutron generation, that exploit a double-layer target to reduce the requirements for the laser system.},

	%abstract = {Laser-wakefield accelerators (LWFAs) were proposed more than three decades ago, and while they promise to deliver compact, high energy particle accelerators, they will also provide the scientific community with novel light sources. In a LWFA, where an intense laser pulse focused onto a plasma forms an electromagnetic wave in its wake, electrons can be trapped and are now routinely accelerated to GeV energies. From terahertz radiation to gamma-rays, this article reviews light sources from relativistic electrons produced by LWFAs, and discusses their potential applications. Betatron motion, Compton scattering and undulators respectively produce x-rays or gamma-rays by oscillating relativistic electrons in the wakefield behind the laser pulse, a counter-propagating laser field, or a magnetic undulator. Other LWFA-based light sources include bremsstrahlung and terahertz radiation. We first evaluate the performance of each of these light sources, and compare them with more conventional approaches, including radio frequency accelerators or other laser-driven sources. We have then identified applications, which we discuss in details, in a broad range of fields: medical and biological applications, military, defense and industrial applications, and condensed matter and high energy density science.},

Near-critical plasmas with controlled properties can be obtained with nanostructured low-density materials. By means of 3D Particle-In-Cell simulations, we investigate how realistic nanostructures influence the interaction of an ultra-intense laser with a plasma having a near-critical average electron density. We find that the presence of a nanostructure strongly reduces the effect of pulse polarization and enhances the energy absorbed by the ion population, while generally leading to a significant decrease of the electron temperature with respect to a homogeneous near-critical plasma. We also observe an effect of the nanostructure morphology. These results are relevant both for a fundamental understanding and for the foreseen applications of laser-plasma interaction in the near-critical regime.},

	%abstract = {A possible setup for the experimental verification of linear Breit-Wheeler pair creation of electrons and positrons in photon-photon collisions is studied theoretically. It combines highly energetic bremsstrahlung photons, which are assumed to be generated by an incident beam of GeV electrons penetrating through a high-$Z$ target, with keV photons from an X-ray laser field, which is described as a focused Gaussian pulse. We discuss the dependencies of the pair yields on the incident electron energy, target thickness, laser parameters, and collision geometry. It is shown that, for suitable conditions which are nowadays in reach at X-ray laser facilities, the resulting number of created particles seems to be well accessible for enabling the first experimental observation of the linear Breit-Wheeler process $\gamma\gamma\to e^+e^-$.},

It is found that this process is unimportant if the polar caps are not hot enough, but will play a non-negligible role in the pair formation cascades when the polar cap temperatures are in excess of the critical temperatures, $T\_\{cri\}$, which are around $4\times 10^6K$ when $P=0.1$s and will slowly increase with increasing periods. Compared with the $\gamma-B$ process, it is found that the two-photon annihilation process may ignite a central spark near the magnetic pole, where $\gamma-B$ sparks can not be formed due to the local weak curvatures. This central spark is large if the gap is dominated by the ``resonant ICS mode''. The possible connection of these central sparks with the observed pulsar ``core'' emission components is discussed.},

The background is represented by E=ηjb, where η is the resistivity and jb is the background current density. Collisions, electric and magnetic fields, and changes in resistivity due to heating of the background are included. Rotational symmetry is assumed. The treatment is valid for fast electron number densities much less than that of the background, fast electron energies much greater than the background temperature, and time scales short enough that magnetic diffusion and thermal conduction are negligible. The neglect of ionization also limits the validity of the model. The intensities at which electric and magnetic fields become important are evaluated. The electric field lowers the energy of fast electrons penetrating the target. The magnetic field reduces the radial spread, increases the penetration of intermediate energy fast electrons, and reflects lower energy fast electrons. Changes in resistivity significantly affect the field generation. The implications for Kα emission diagnostics are discussed.},

The two cases of far subthermal and of far superthermal electron drift motions are accessible to a rigorous analytical treatment. We show that the lower cut off $b\_\{\min\}$ is a function of symmetry and shape of the shielding cloud, it is not universal. In the subthermal case shielding is spherical and $b\_\{\min\}$ is to be identified with the de Broglie wavelength; at superthermal drift the shielding cloud exhibits cylindrical (axial) symmetry and $b\_\{\min\}$ is the classical parameter of perpendicular deflection. In both situations the cut offs are determined by the electron-ion encounters at large collision parameters. This is in net contrast to the governing standard meaning that attributes $b\_\{\min\}$ to the Coulomb singularity at vanishing collision parameters $b$ and, consequently, assigns it universal validity. The origin of the contradictions in the traditional picture is analyzed.},

	%abstract = {We report on recent progress on laser-plasma acceleration using a low energy and high-repetition rate laser system. Using only few milliJoule laser energy, in conjunction with extremely short pulses composed of a single optical cycle, we demonstrate that the laser-plasma accelerator (LPA) can be operated close to the resonant blowout regime. This results in the production of high charge electron beams (>10 pC) with peaked energy distributions in the few MeV range and relatively narrow divergence angles. We highlight the importance of the plasma density profile and gas jet design for the performance of the LPA. In this extreme regime of relativistic laser-plasma interaction with near-single-cycle laser pulses, we find that the effect of group velocity dispersion and carrier envelope phase can no longer be neglected. These advances bring LPAs closer to real scientific applications in ultrafast probing.},

	%abstract = {This study examines single-particle electron motions in both a plane electromagnetic wave and a Gaussian focus in vacuum. Exact, explicit analytic expressions for relativistic electron trajectories in a plane wave are obtained, using the proper time as a parameter, in the general case of arbitrary initial positions and velocities. It is shown that previous analyses can be completed using the proper-time parameter. The conditions under which localized oscillatory motions (‘figure-of-eight’ orbits) occur are derived from the new solutions. The general solutions are also connected with the figure-of-eight orbits by a Lorentz transformation. The analytic solutions for arbitrary initial conditions and an arbitrary initial field phase can be used to determine the ranges of electron ejection angle and emerging electron energy in a vacuum laser accelerator, in which electrons are ejected externally, and provide a basis for explaining the spectrum of nonlinear Thomson scattering radiation. Numerical solutions are used for electron motions in the focus of a Gaussian laser beam, and the mean motion allows one to test a new expression for the relativistic ponderomotive force. It is suggested that plane wave solutions can provide a basis for approximating the orbital motion of particles in Gaussian beams.},

Here, by designing a cascaded laser wakefield accelerator to generate high-quality monoenergetic e-beams, which are bound to head-on collide with the intense driving laser pulse via the reflection of a 20-um-thick Ti foil, we produce tunable quasi-monochromatic MeV $\gamma$-rays (33\% full-width at half-maximum) with a peak brilliance of ~3 × 1022 photons s−1 mm−2 mrad−2 0.1\% BW at 1 MeV.

Based on radiation from electrons accelerated in plasma, these sources have the common properties to be compact and to deliver collimated, incoherent and femtosecond radiation. In this article we review, within a unified formalism, the betatron radiation of trapped and accelerated electrons in the so-called bubble regime, the synchrotron radiation of laser-accelerated electrons in usual meter-scale undulators, the nonlinear Thomson scattering from relativistic electrons oscillating in an intense laser field, and the Thomson backscattered radiation of a laser beam by laser-accelerated electrons. The underlying physics is presented using ideal models, the relevant parameters are defined, and analytical expressions providing the features of the sources are given. Numerical simulations and a summary of recent experimental results on the different mechanisms are also presented. Each section ends with the foreseen development of each scheme. Finally, one of the most promising applications of laser-plasma accelerators is discussed: the realization of a compact free-electron laser in the x-ray range of the spectrum. In the conclusion, the relevant parameters characterizing each sources are summarized. Considering typical laser-plasma interaction parameters obtained with currently available lasers, examples of the source features are given. The sources are then compared to each other in order to define their field of applications.},

	%abstract = {Classical Thomson scattering1 — the scattering of low-intensity light by electrons — is a linear process, in that it does not change the frequency of the radiation; moreover, the magnetic-field component of light is not involved. But if the light intensity is extremely high (∼1018 W cm−2), the electrons oscillate during the scattering process with velocities approaching the speed of light. In this relativistic regime, the effect of the magnetic and electric fields on the electron motion should become comparable, and the effective electron mass will increase. Consequently, electrons in such high fields are predicted to quiver nonlinearly, moving in figure-of-eight patterns rather than in straight lines. Scattered photons should therefore be radiated at harmonics of the frequency of the incident light2,3,4,5,6,7,8, with each harmonic having its own unique angular distribution4,5,6. Ultrahigh-peak-power lasers9 offer a means of creating the huge photon densities required to study relativistic, or ‘nonlinear’ (ref. 6), Thomson scattering. Here we use such an approach to obtain direct experimental confirmation of the theoretical predictions of relativistic Thomson scattering. In the future, it may be possible to achieve coherent10,11 generation of the harmonics, a process that could be potentially utilized for ‘table-top’ X-ray sources.},

Combined with advances in our understanding of the kinetics of relativistic plasma, studies of laser–plasma interactions are entering a new regime where the physics of relativistic plasmas is strongly affected by strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED) processes, including hard photon emission and electron–positron (eÀ–eþ) pair production. This coupling of quantum emission processes and relativistic collective particle dynamics can result in dramatically new plasma physics phenomena, such as the generation of dense eÀ–eþ pair plasma from near vacuum, complete laser energy absorption by QED processes, or the stopping of an ultrarelativistic electron beam, which could penetrate a cm of lead, by a hair’s breadth of laser light. In addition to being of fundamental interest, it is crucial to study this new regime to understand the next generation of ultra-high intensity laser-matter experiments and their resulting applications, such as high energy ion, electron, positron, and photon sources for fundamental physics studies, medical radiotherapy, and next generation radiography for homeland security and industry.},

When an intense, short Gaussian laser pulse of circular polarization propagates in near-critical plasma, it drives strong currents of relativistic electrons which magnetize the plasma. Three pulse shaping effects are synchronously observed when the laser passes through the plasma lens. The laser intensity is increased by more than 1 order of magnitude while the initial Gaussian profile undergoes self-modulation longitudinally and develops a steep front. Meanwhile, a nonrelativistic prepulse can be absorbed by the overcritical plasma lens, which can improve the laser contrast without affecting laser shaping of the main pulse.

However, this method only produces a single $\gamma$-ray beam. In this paper, we report on the numerical study for the feasibility of producing double $\gamma$-ray beams using a 1 PW laser. Our method utilizes the all-optical setup with a structured solid target as a reﬂecting foil. The laser pulse is reﬂected by the foil after propagating a few millimeters into the underdense plasma. The reﬂected laser intensity is strongly boosted by the foil to invoke a radiation reaction as nonlinear Compton backscattering. Subsequently, the electron bunch traverses the foil, generating bremsstrahlung. Our simulation results show that a collimated $\gamma$-ray beam from the nonlinear Compton backscattering with the peak brilliance of 6.7×1020 photons/s/mm2/mrad2/0.1\%BW at 15 MeV is produced. Another collimated $\gamma$-ray beam with the peak brilliance of 2.1×106 photons/s/mm2/mrad2/0.1\%BW is produced by bremsstrahlung. The combined $\gamma$-ray beams act as a blaster and are of particular interest in nuclear interactions induced by high-energy photons.},

Such a laser pulse can be obtained by the preceding interaction of the incoming laser pulse with a thin solid-density foil. Using numerical simulations we study how such a laser pulse affects photon emission. As a result of employing a laser pulse with a steep rising edge, accelerated electrons can interact directly with the most intense part of the laser pulse that enhances photon emission.

We observe ultra-short electron bunches emerging from laser wake fields driven above the wavebreaking threshold by few-cycle laser pulses shorter than the plasma wavelength. We find a new regime in which the laser wake takes the shape of a solitary plasma cavity. It traps background electrons continuously and accelerates them. We show that 12-J, 33-fs laser pulses may produce bunches of 3 × 1010 electrons with energy sharply peaked around 300 MeV. These electrons emerge as low-emittance beams from plasma layers just 700-µm thick. We also address a regime intermediate between direct laser acceleration and LWFA, when the laser-pulse duration is comparable with the plasma period.},

	%abstract = {We investigate the electron heating induced by a relativistic-intensity laser pulse propagating through a near-critical plasma. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we show that a specific interaction regime sets in when, due to the energy depletion caused by the plasma wakefield, the laser front profile has steepened to the point of having a length scale close to the laser wavelength. Wave breaking and phase mixing have then occurred, giving rise to a relativistically hot electron population following the laser pulse. This hot electron flow is dense enough to neutralize the cold bulk electrons during their backward acceleration by the wakefield. This neutralization mechanism delays, but does not prevent the breaking of the wakefield: the resulting phase mixing converts the large kinetic energy of the backward-flowing electrons into thermal energy greatly exceeding the conventional ponderomotive scaling at laser intensities and gas densities around 10\% of the critical density. We develop a semi-numerical model, based on the Akhiezer–Polovin equations, which correctly reproduces the particle-in-cell-predicted electron thermal energies over a broad parameter range. Given this good agreement, we propose a criterion for full laser absorption that includes field-induced ionization. Finally, we show that our predictions still hold in a two-dimensional geometry using a realistic gas profile.},

	%abstract = {When a strong laser beam irradiates a solid target, a hot plasma is produced and high-energy electrons are usually generated (the so-called “hot electrons”). These energetic electrons subsequently generate hard X-rays in the solid target through the Bremsstrahlung process. To date, only limited studies have been conducted on this laser-induced radiological protection issue. In this study, extensive literature reviews on the physics and properties of hot electrons have been conducted. On the basis of these information, the photon dose generated by the interaction between hot electrons and a solid target was simulated with the Monte Carlo code FLUKA. With some reasonable assumptions, the calculated dose can be regarded as the upper boundary of the experimental results over the laser intensity ranging from 1019 to 1021 W/cm2. Furthermore, an equation to estimate the photon dose generated from ultraintense laser–solid interactions based on the normalized laser intensity is derived. The shielding eﬀects of common materials including concrete and lead were also studied for the laser-driven X-ray source. The dose transmission curves and tenth-value layers (TVLs) in concrete and lead were calculated through Monte Carlo simulations. These results could be used to perform a preliminary and fast radiation safety assessment for the X-rays generated from ultraintense laser–solid interactions.},

	%abstract = {Experiments were performed to study electron acceleration by intense sub-picosecond laser pulses propagating in sub-mm long plasmas of near critical electron density (NCD). Low density foam layers of 300–500 μm thickness were used as targets. In foams, the NCD-plasma was produced by a mechanism of super-sonic ionization when a well-defined separate ns-pulse was sent onto the foamtarget forerunning the relativistic main pulse. The application of sub-mm thick low density foam layers provided a substantial increase of the electron acceleration path in a NCD-plasma compared to the case of freely expanding plasmas created in the interaction of the ns-laser pulse with solid foils. The performed experiments on the electron heating by a 100 J, 750 fs short laser pulse of 2–5×1019 W cm−2 intensity demonstrated that the effective temperature of supra-thermal electrons increased from 1.5–2 MeV in the case of the relativistic laser interaction with a metallic foil at high laser contrast up to 13 MeV for the laser shots onto the pre-ionized foam. The observed tendency towards a strong increase of the mean electron energy and the number of ultra-relativistic laseraccelerated electrons is reinforced by the results of gamma-yield measurements that showed a 1000fold increase of the measured doses. The experiment was supported by 3D-PIC and FLUKA simulations, which considered the laser parameters and the geometry of the experimental set-up. Both, measurements and simulations showed a high directionality of the acceleration process, since the strongest increase in the electron energy, charge and corresponding gamma-yield was observed close to the direction of the laser pulse propagation. The charge of super-ponderomotive electrons with energy above 30 MeV reached a very high value of 78 nC.},

These targets are found to significantly narrow the electron angular distribution as well as produce significantly higher energies. These features combine to create a significant enhancement in directionality and energy of the Bremstrahlung radiation produced by a high-Z converter target. These studies employ short-pulse, high intensity laser pulses, and indicate that novel target design has potential to greatly enhance the yield and narrow the directionality of high energy electrons and $\gamma$-rays. We find that the peak $\gamma$-ray brightness for this source is 6.0 × 1019 s−1 mm−2 mrad−2 at 10 MeV and 1.4 × 1019 s−1 mm−2 mrad−2 at 100 MeV (0.1\% bandwidth).},

	%abstract = {Electron acceleration has been optimized based on 3D particle-in-cell simulations of a short laser pulse interacting with low-density plasma targets to find the pulse propagation regime that maximizes the charge of high-energy electron bunches. This regime corresponds to laser pulse propagation in a self-trapping mode where the diffraction divergence is balanced by the relativistic nonlinearity such that relativistic self-focusing on the axis does not happen and the laser beam radius stays unchanged during pulse propagation in a plasma over many Rayleigh lengths. Such a regime occurs for a near-critical density if the pulse length considerably exceeds both the plasma wavelength and the pulse width. Electron acceleration occurs in a traveling cavity filled with a high-frequency laser field and a longitudinal electrostatic single-cycle field (“self-trapping regime”). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that a high electron yield allows an efficient production of gamma radiation, electron–positron pairs, neutrons, and even pions from a catcher-target.},

	%abstract = {The emergence of a new era reaching beyond current state-of-the-art ultrashort and ultraintense laser technology has been enabled by the approval of around € 850 million worth of structural funds in 2011–2012 by the European Commission for the installation of Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI). The ELI project consists of three pillars being built in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Romania. This challenging proposal is based on recent technical progress allowing ultraintense laser fields in which intensities will soon be reaching as high as I0 ∼ 1023 W cm−2. This tremendous technological advance has been brought about by the invention of chirped pulse amplification by Mourou and Strickland. Romania is hosting the ELI for Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) pillar in Măgurele near Bucharest. The new facility, currently under construction, is intended to serve the broad national, European, and international scientific community. Its mission covers scientific research at the frontier of knowledge involving two domains. The first is laser-driven experiments related to NP, strong-field quantum electrodynamics, and associated vacuum effects. The second research domain is based on the establishment of a Compton-backscattering-based, high-brilliance, and intense $\gamma$ beam with E$\gamma$ ≲ 19.5 MeV, which represents a merger between laser and accelerator technology. This system will allow the investigation of the nuclear structure of selected isotopes and nuclear reactions of relevance, for example, to astrophysics with hitherto unprecedented resolution and accuracy. In addition to fundamental themes, a large number of applications with significant societal impact will be developed. The implementation of the project started in January 2013 and is spearheaded by the ELI-NP/Horia Hulubei National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering (IFIN-HH). Experiments will begin in early 2020.},

	%abstract = {La génération de faisceaux particules par accélération laser-plasma est devenu un domaine qui ne cesse de croître, en particulier pour ses nombreuses applications intéressantes. Un des mécanismes les plus utilisés pour l'accélération de protons sur des systèmes laser de plusieurs centaines de térawatts (TW) est basé sur l'irradiation d'une mince cible solide métallique, générant une accélération de protons sur sa face arrière. Afin d'optimiser le processus, il est donc nécessaire de maximiser le transfert d'énergie du laser aux particules et pour ce faire, plusieurs groupes de recherche ont adressé ce problème en utilisant des cibles nanostructurées [1, 2].     Dans ce projet de doctorat, nous développerons des cibles nanostructurées permettant une meilleure absorption du faisceau laser incident comparativement aux cibles conventionnelles. Ces nouvelles cibles nanostructurées seront produites par une méthode bien plus simple et moins coûteuse que les méthodes lithographiques utilisées en général. Le développement de la méthode de fabrication a mené à une publication récente par notre groupe de recherche [3]. Plusieurs couches de nanoparticules métalliques (Au, Ag) sont déposées sur des cibles solides conventionnelles (feuilles minces d'Au et Al) et permettent une augmentation de l'absorption de photons. Ceci permet ultimement d'augmenter le transfert d'énergie du laser aux particules, et donc d'accroître le rendement en protons. Le but principal de ce projet est de tester différents types de cibles nanostructurées utilisées pour améliorer les caractéristiques du faisceau de protons. Le projet peut être divisé selon les objectifs suivants:    1) Effectuer des simulations PIC afin de comprendre les processus phénoménologiques derrière le rehaussement des caractéristiques du faisceau de protons. Plusieurs géométries de cibles ainsi que différents paramètres laser seront testés numériquement afin de déterminer le point optimal pour obtenir un faisceau de protons aux caractéristiques accrues.    2) Optimiser la génération de faisceaux de protons en testant expérimentalement différents types de cibles nanostructurées, en utilisant la méthode de fabrication précédemment développée. Ces expériences seront guidées par les paramètres optimaux trouvés lors des simulations du précédent objectif.    Tout les travaux expérimentaux seront effectués à l'INRS-EMT sur l'Advanced Laser Light Source (ALLS) ayant une puissant crête de 500 TW, sous la supervision du professeur Patrizio Antici. Concernant les simulations, elles seront effectuées au CELIA de l'Université de Bordeaux, sous la supervision du professeur Emmanuel d'Humières.

	%abstract = {Bremsstrahlung emission from interactions of short ultra-intense laser pulses with solid foils is studied using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. A module for simulating bremsstrahlung has been implemented in the PIC loop to self-consistently account for the dynamics of the laser–plasma interaction, plasma expansion, and the emission of gamma ray photons. This module made it possible to study emission from thin targets, where reﬂuxing of hot electrons plays an important role. It is shown that the angular distribution of the emitted photons exhibits a four-directional structure with the angle of emission decreasing with the increase of the width of the target. Additionally, a collimated forward ﬂash consisting of high energy photons has been identified in thin targets. The conversion efficiency of the energy of the laser pulse to the energy of the gamma rays rises with both the driving pulse intensity, and the thickness of the target. The amount of gamma rays also increases with the atomic number of the target material, despite a lower absorption of the driving laser pulse. The angular spectrum of the emitted gamma rays is directly related to the increase of hot electron divergence during their reﬂuxing and its measurement can be used in experiments to study this process.},

These electron beams can subsequently be used to generate short-lived particles such as positrons, muons, and pions. In recent experiments, we have made the first measurements of pion production using ‘all optical’ methods. In particular, we have demonstrated that the interaction of bremsstrahlung generated by laser driven electron beams with aluminum atoms can produce the long lived isotope of magnesium (27Mg) which is a signature for pion (π+) production and subsequent muon decay. Using a 300 TW laser pulse, we have measured the generation of 150 ± 50 pions per shot. We also show that the energetic electron beam is a source of an intense, highly directional neutron beam resulting from ($\gamma$, n) reactions which contributes to the 27Mg measurement as background via the (n, p) process.},

The Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI) project offers the possibility of a new window into this largely unexplored world. I review these ideas, along with some new results, explaining why quantum field theorists are so interested in this rapidly developing field of laser science. I concentrate on the theoretical tools that have been developed to analyze nonperturbative vacuum pair production.},

	%abstract = {L'avènement d'une nouvelle génération de lasers ultra-relativistes (d'éclairement supérieur à 10^22 W/cm2), tels le laser APOLLON sur le plateau de Saclay, donnera lieu à un régime d'interaction laser-matière sans précédent, couplant physique des plasmas relativistes et effets électrodynamiques quantiques. Sources de particules et de rayonnements aux propriétés énergétiques et spatio-temporelles inédites, ces lasers serviront, entre autres applications, à la mise au point de nouveaux concepts d'accélérateurs et de diagnostics radiographiques, au chauffage de plasmas denses, comme à la reproduction de configurations astrophysiques en laboratoire.  En prévision des futures expériences, les codes particle-in-cell (PIC), qui constituent les outils de référence pour la simulation de l'interaction laser-plasma, doivent être enrichis des processus radiatifs et quantiques propres à ce nouveau régime d'interaction. C'est le cas du code CALDER développé au CEA/DAM, qui modélise désormais l'émission de photons énergétiques et la conversion de ceux-ci en paires électron-positron ; autant d'effets susceptibles d'affecter le bilan d'énergie de l'interaction laser-cible et, plus précisément, le rendement du laser en particules et rayonnements énergétiques.     L'objet de ce stage théorique est d'étudier, à l'aide du code CALDER, l'influence de ces processus dans un certain nombre de scénarios physiques en champ extrême (accélération électronique et ionique dans un plasma surcritique, production de rayonnement, génération de choc non-collisionnel…).},

Here we show that it is possible to create $\{>\}10^8$ positrons by dual laser irradiation of a structured plasma target, at intensities of $2 \times 10^\{22\} \mathrm\{W\}\mathrm\{cm\}^\{-2\}$. In contrast to previous work, the pair creation is primarily driven by the linear Breit-Wheeler process ($\gamma\gamma \to e^+ e^-$), not the nonlinear process assumed to be dominant at high intensity, because of the high density of $\gamma$ rays emitted inside the target. The favorable scaling with laser intensity of the linear process prompts reconsideration of its neglect in simulation studies, but also permits positron jet formation at intensities that are already experimentally feasible. Simulations show that the positrons, confined by a quasistatic plasma magnetic field, may be accelerated by the lasers to energies $> 200$ MeV.},

	%abstract = {The basic physical processes in laser–matter interaction, up to 1017W/cm2 (for a Neodymium laser) are now well understood, on the other hand, new phenomena evidenced in particle-in-cell (PIC) code simulations have to be investigated above. Thus, the relativistic motion of a charged particle in a linearly polarized homogeneous electromagnetic wave is studied, in this paper, using the Hamiltonian formalism. First, the motion of a single particle in a linearly polarized traveling wave propagating in a non-magnetized space is explored. The problem is shown to be integrable. The results obtained are compared to those derived considering a cold electron plasma model. When the phase velocity is close to c, it is shown that the two approaches are in good agreement during a finite time. After this short time, even when the plasma response is taken into account no chaos takes place at least when considering low densities and/or high wave intensities. The case of a charged particle in a traveling wave propagating along a constant homogeneous magnetic field is then considered. The problem is shown to be integrable when the wave propagates in vacuum. The existence of a synchronous solution is shown very simply. In the case when the wave propagates in a low density plasma, using a simplifying Lorentz transformation, it is shown that the system can be reduced to a time-dependent system with two degrees of freedom. The system is shown to be nonintegrable, chaos appears when a secondary resonance and a primary resonance overlap. Finally, stochastic instabilities are studied by considering the motion of one particle in a very high intensity wave perturbed by one or two low intensity traveling waves. Resonances are identified and conditions for resonance overlap are studied. PIC code simulation results confirm the occurrence of stochastic heating.},

Using a 6−μm polyethylene target, up to 4×108 electrons with energies between 5 and 60 MeV were produced per laser pulse and converted to $\gamma$ rays by bremsstrahlung in a Ta secondary target. The rates of photofission of U as well as photonuclear reactions in Cu, Au, and C samples have been measured. In optimal focusing conditions, about 0.06\% of the laser energy has been converted to outgoing electrons with energies above 5 MeV.

Large currents of background electrons can then be trapped and subsequently accelerated by these relativistic waves. In the forced laser wake field regime, where the laser pulse length is of the order of the plasma wavelength, we show that a gain in maximum electron energy of up to 200 megaelectronvolts can be achieved, along with an improvement in the quality of the ultrashort electron beam.</p>},

	%abstract = {The interaction of intense laser beams with plasmas created on solid targets involves a rich nonlinear physics. Because such dense plasmas are reflective for laser light, the coupling with the incident beam occurs within a thin layer at the interface between plasma and vacuum. One of the main paradigms used to understand this coupling, known as the Brunel mechanism, is expected to be valid only for very steep plasma surfaces. Despite innumerable studies, its validity range remains uncertain, and the physics involved for smoother plasma-vacuum interfaces is unclear, especially for ultrahigh laser intensities. We report the first comprehensive experimental and numerical study of the laser-plasma coupling mechanisms as a function of the plasma interface steepness, in the relativistic interaction regime. Our results reveal a clear transition from the temporally periodic Brunel mechanism to a chaotic dynamic associated to stochastic heating. By revealing the key signatures of these two distinct regimes on experimental observables, we provide an important landmark for the interpretation of future experiments.},

	%abstract = {Particle-in-cell merging algorithms aim to resample dynamically the six-dimensional phase space occupied by particles without distorting substantially the physical description of the system. Whereas various approaches have been proposed in previous works, none of them seemed to be able to conserve fully charge, momentum, energy and their associated distributions. We describe here an alternative algorithm based on the coalescence of N massive or massless particles, considered to be close enough in phase space, into two new macro-particles. The local conservation of charge, momentum and energy are ensured by the resolution of a system of scalar equations. Various simulation comparisons have been carried out with and without the merging algorithm, from classical plasma physics problems to extreme scenarios where quantum electrodynamics is taken into account, showing in addition to the conservation of local quantities, the good reproducibility of the particle distributions. In case where the number of particles ought to increase exponentially in the simulation box, the dynamical merging permits a considerable speedup, and significant memory savings that otherwise would make the simulations impossible to perform.},

	title = {Electron-positron pair production in the collision of real photon beams with wide energy distributions},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09099},
	%abstract = {The creation of an electron-positron pair in the collision of two real photons, namely the linear Breit-Wheeler process, has never been detected directly in the laboratory since its prediction in 1934 despite its fundamental importance in quantum electrodynamics and astrophysics. In the last few years, several experimental setup have been proposed to observe this process in the laboratory, relying either on thermal radiation, Bremsstrahlung, linear or multiphoton inverse Compton scattering photons sources created by lasers or by the mean of a lepton collider coupled with lasers. In these propositions, the influence of the photons' energy distribution on the total number of produced pairs has been taken into account with an analytical model only for two of these cases. We hereafter develop a general and original, semi-analytical model to estimate the influence of the photons energy distribution on the total number of pairs produced by the collision of two such photon beams, and give optimum energy parameters for some of the proposed experimental configurations. Our results shows that the production of optimum Bremsstrahlung and linear inverse Compton sources are, only from energy distribution considerations, already reachable in today's facilities. Despite its less interesting energy distribution features for the LBW pair production, the photon sources generated via multiphoton inverse Compton scattering by the propagation of a laser in a micro-channel can also be interesting, thank to the high collision luminosity that could eventually be reached by such configurations. These results then gives important insights for the design of experiments intended to detect linear Breit-Wheeler produced positrons in the laboratory for the first time.},
